# NoxPlayerPortable

Fork form: https://github.com/BlueMagicalWolf/NoxPlayerPortable

A script that will make a almost portable version of NoxPlayer (Windows Only)

## How to run setup:

- run `Setup.cmd`.
- after the script complete running the folder noxplayer is ready to beign copied, you can copy that folder to whereever you want (like a usb).

## How to launch:

to launch noxplayer, run the exe file in the noxplayer folder (normal you would use Nox.exe).

i need to find a way to redirect Program files since it cant run without Bignox and thats a problem since i cant get it to work in the same folder...

Sorry for my bad english
